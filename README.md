README 
This is a practice run on my first README.md file.
The project I will be working on is a basic recipe website.
I don't expect it to be very aesthetically pleasing. However I do
hope to showcase an ability to preform basic HTML. 
My hope is for a better understanding, and to get a feel for writing
code and computing in general.
